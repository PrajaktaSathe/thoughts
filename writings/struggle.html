					What's Life Without A Little Struggle
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<div>
					What's life without a little struggle? Struggle is a part everyone's life. Everyone has their own share of struggles. If we think about it, life itself is a struggle for some people.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					The concept and magnitude of struggle is different from every person's perspective. Every living being is a part of a constant struggle for something or the other. The thing about struggles is that we believe that we are struggling more than all the other people in the world. We forget to notice that people across the world have to struggle for even their basic necessities - like water, food and clothing (no, the list of basic necessities does not include wifi).
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					I believe that obtaining something after a struggle increases value of that thing. Think of something you got very easily (maybe as a gift?), versus something for which you had to give a tough fight, had to put all your hardwork and effort into. Which of the above would you care for more? Which would be more precious and more dear to your heart? Obviously, the one you had to struggle for, right? Because, the more one has to struggle for something, the more importance one gives to that thing in life. Sweet are the fruits of labour. Come to think of it; even a small baby struggles - to talk, to stand-up, to eat etc.
				</div>

				<div>
					Stuggles can be considered to be stepping stones to success. They are of paramount importance, for, they highlight the steps you took, the challenges you faced in pursuit of something. If you struggle, it is proof that you are trying. And trying is more important than anything else. Now, it is your choice whether to let your struggles lift you up, or pull you down.
