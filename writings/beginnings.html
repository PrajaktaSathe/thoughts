					Beginnings
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<div>
					So, I had a strong urge to write, since a long time. And, yet I just couldn't bring myself to write. Something always came in my way. Sometimes it was college timings, and on other days it was those really really long, never-ending assignments (although I still haven't been able to reason with why they burden us with so many assignments) which are quite mundane. Okay, assignments are, in themselves a form of writing, but not the one I prefer! Yet another thing that came in my way was my laziness.

					Back in my school days, the first half hour of school was spent on writing something. It was quite an useful thing as it not only enhanced my English-speaking capabilities, but also made my thinking more profound. unfortunately, the habit no longer coontinued after school. Remembering this, I decided to start once again.

					This summer I decided that I would begin writing once again, with renewed vigour, no matter what happens. Accordingly, I decided a timing, and sat down with an opened notebook and pen, in front of me. Alas, I couldn't achieve much that day. I couldn't really think of anything to write about. And whatever ideas came to my mind, I couldn't really put it into words. I was disheartened that I couldn't write.

					I would say, though, that I was happy that I had atleast started with something. The beginnings are quite important you know. The first step is crucial in determining your further journey. No doubt it is also the toughest one, and, that is why many people refrain from taking it. They say - "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step", and I totally agree. Unless and until you start, you will never know what you can achieve. The rest of the journey may be smooth or however it may be, you will have the courage to continue. The more courage you show in beginning something new, the more interesting your life will be.
