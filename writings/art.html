					Discover Yourself through Art
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<div>
					<q class="quotes">Art is a way to lose ourselves and find ourselves at the same time.</q> 
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					Art is very essential in our life. 
					I simply cannot state in words it's importance. 
					I feel that we are incomplete without it. 
					Art gives us a chance to discover new worlds while also discovering ourselves in the process. 
					The beautiful thing about art is that nothing can ever be right or wrong. 
					It gives us the opportunity to express ourselves where words fail to do so. 
					It is the ability to see things that are not actually how they appear to be. It is seeing the beauty behind the scenes. 
					Looking at art is looking at someone's mind. Art has the power to change people's perspectives. 
					It has the ability to make people look at things in a more optimistic way. Art is life. Art can be anything and everything.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					I believe that there is an artist hidden in every person. 
					The only thing is to try to connect with our inner self, and you will also find an artist in yourself. 
					By saying 'art', I do not only necessarily mean drawing and painting. Infact, the word 'art', in itself is a huge open-source dictionary. 
					The ancient texts reveal 64 forms of art in total. You can google it up and see the list yourself.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					We are often so busy in our daily routines, that it becomes quite impossible to find time for ourselves. 
					Just as the left-brain is useful in the technical, analytical sides, the right-brain represents our aesthetic abilities. 
					We forget that we also have this right-brain with it's wonderful capabilities, and more often than not, we become chained by the left-brain. 
					We should try to create a balance between both. Consequently, we will also create harmony and happiness in our life.
